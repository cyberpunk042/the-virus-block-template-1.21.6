# 🦠 THE VIRUS BLOCK — Beginning of the End

**A Minecraft mod that lets you destroy your entire world… one mutation at a time.**  
Place a single block.  
Watch your dimension collapse into chaos.

Perfect for:
- Streamers  
- Challenge runs  
- SMP events  
- “Hardcore but getting worse every minute” experiences  

Once the **Virus Block** is placed, your dimension enters a progressive, escalating corruption arc that alters every part of Minecraft: mobs, blocks, worldgen, weather, cave physics, and even player behavior.

There is no going back.  
Only survival.

## 🧬 Core Concept

When the Virus Block is activated:

- Your dimension is flagged as **infected**  
- Mutation systems turn on  
- Chaos escalates in **five infection tiers**  
- The world becomes progressively more hostile, unstable, and unpredictable  

This mod transforms Minecraft into a living apocalypse simulator.

---

## 📈 Infection Tiers

The Virus spreads through **five escalating tiers**:

### Tier 1 — Mild Corruption

- Local block mutations around the Virus Block  
- Single-block flickers / texture glitches  
- Passive mobs stare, follow, or mirror players  
- Virus Aura: light poison ticks; stand too long on an Infectious Cube and it starts nibbling half-hearts  
- Carrying an Infectious Cube in your inventory for a few seconds gives intermittent **Hunger** + **Nausea**

### Tier 2 — Environmental Decay

- Random mutation pulses across loaded chunks  
- Fluids begin corrupting (murky water / tainted lava)  
- Small cave-ins during mining and the first **Collapse Surge** events  
- Hostile arrows occasionally fall from the sky  
- Boobytraps start appearing, but at a low density

### Tier 3 — Hostile Ecosystem

- Passive mobs become corrupted and aggressive  
- Terrain patches convert to corrupted biomes; surface carpets of corrupted sand/ice/snow spread quickly  
- TNT meteors / Skyfall begin  
- Void Tears become possible once Tier 3 extras are enabled  
- Boobytrap spread and bonus hostile spawns ramp up significantly

### Tier 4 — Reality Warping

- Random gravity collapses, sideways block falls, inversion events  
- Mobs gain random abilities: speed, crits, explosions, venom, knockback  
- Fluids misbehave in corrupted zones; Collapse Surge becomes lethal  
- Entity Duplication can trigger if Tier 4 extras stay enabled

### Tier 5 — The Endgame

- Biomes collapse or invert outright  
- Massive TNT/Arrow barrages, corruption waves, and entity duplication storms  
- Corrupted TNT now rolls volatile results (1/3 dud, 1/3 normal, 1/3 1.5× blast) to keep finales unpredictable  
- Bonus hostile mob spawns spike to their highest density thanks to tier-aware scaling  
- A guardian-beam shock field forms around every cocoon during the first half of Tier 5, repeatedly shoving intruders backward  
- Once the tier bar fills, **Apocalypse Mode** begins with a sonic blast that yeets anyone camping the Virus Block.

### 🔻 Apocalypse Mode (Post-Tier 5)

Once the Tier 5 progress bar finishes, every Virus Block sheds its shells, the bossbar switches to a red health readout, and the corruption enters its terminal phase:

- The Virus Block becomes fully vulnerable; melee hits, arrows, TNT, and Purification option 4 all drain its health.
- Purification option 3 still halves the block’s max health, shortening the fight without rewinding progress.
- The calm/progress bossbar is hidden; only the red health bar remains while vulnerable.
- When Virus HP reaches zero *or* you finish mining the exposed block, the infection is cleansed and the world begins to recover.
- (Future roadmap: a Singularity-style fail-safe may return later if players ignore Apocalypse Mode for too long, but it is currently disabled.)

## 🧩 Corrupted Block Variants

Every vanilla block can spawn a **corrupted variant**:

Examples:

- **Corrupted Stone:** behaves like sand  
- **Corrupted Glass:** explodes when broken  
- **Corrupted Dirt:** spawns bitey worms  
- **Corrupted Wood:** ignites when walked on  
- **Corrupted Iron Block:** magnetic pull on items  
- **Corrupted Ice:** creates hallucinations  

Over time, your world becomes an alien landscape.

---

## 🌪️ Global Mutation Events

These occur periodically or randomly:

- **Block Mutation Pulse**  
  Patches of blocks shift all at once into random variants.

- **Skyfall Event**  
  TNT / arrows / random objects rain down over players.

- **Passive Mob Revolt**  
  Cows, pigs, chickens, etc. become corrupted and hostile.

- **Mob Buff Storm**  
  All mobs gain random buffs (speed, strength, explosions, crits, etc.).

- **Liquid Mutation**  
  Water → sludge (slow + poison)  
  Lava → tainted lava (extra dangerous, smoke bursts)

- **Collapse Surge**  
  Stone caves collapse in chain reactions while mining.

- **Void Tears**  
  Temporary mini black holes that suck in nearby entities.

- **Inversion Event**  
  Falling blocks fall UP instead of down for a short duration.

- **Virus Bloom**  
  Plants and trees convert to corrupted flora instantly.

- **Entity Duplication**  
  Random mobs multiply into weaker clones for swarm chaos.

Every session becomes a unique apocalypse.

## 👁️ Virus Aura & Infectious Hazards

- Standing near the Virus Block applies poison, hunger, slowness, nausea, and armor corrosion. Intensity scales with tier.  
- Standing directly **on** an Infectious Cube now ticks damage continuously; Rubber Shoes extend the safe window slightly but the cube will still chew through your footwear first.  
- Carrying an Infectious Cube in your inventory rapidly builds viral load—once the threshold hits you’ll be pulsed with Hunger, Nausea, Weakness, Slowness, and Poison until you drop it or stash it.

Pro tip: cure cubes with milk (shapeless recipe) or quarantine them inside obsidian shells.

## 🛡️ Prototype Anti-Virus Gear

Four late-game armor pieces help you survive the apocalypse while keeping their vanilla enchant pools and trim compatibility:

- **Composite Elytra (Chest)** – Netherite chestplate defense + Elytra glide in a single item. Firework boosts are throttled for balance, but custom Elytra wings render on the player so you keep your silhouette. Repair with Netherite Ingots or Phantom Membranes.  
- **Rubber Shoes (Boots)** – Double durability leather boots tuned for boobytrap crawls: extra tolerance while standing on Infectious Cubes, softer explosion knockback, and reduced damage from trap payloads. Repair with Slimeballs.  
- **Heavy Pants (Leggings)** – Total immunity to Void Tear pull/damage/knockback. The tear eats the leggings’ durability instead of you, so bring spares.  
- **Augmented Helmet (Helmet)** – Emits periodic compass-style pings that point toward the nearest Virus Block or shield anchor, complete with electric spark particles and HUD chat hints.

These items appear in the custom creative tab alongside the vanilla Elytra for easy testing.

## ⚔️ Ending the Infection

Apocalypse Mode is the last phase—there is no separate boss arena right now. Survive the Tier 5 chaos, keep accelerating the Virus Block’s progress, and once the bar flips to red health you can finally fight back:

- Every hit against the Virus Block removes health instead of rewinding progress.
- TNT, bed explosions, and projectiles all deal chunk-based damage; larger blasts chew away more HP.
- Purification totems remain powerful finishers—option 3 reduces max HP, option 4 burns current HP.
- When the health bar empties, the Virus Block disintegrates and the infection resets to zero sources.

---

## 🏛️ Player Tools & Interactions

### Accelerate / Delay Corruption

- Poke the Virus Block to speed up tier progress.  
- Wrap a Cured Infectious Cube in an obsidian cocoon to spawn an **Anti-Virus Field**—a beacon-style dome that stops spread, shields players from anomalies, and detonates violently if the virus reaches it.  

### Temporary Reversion — Purification Totem

- **No Boobytraps** – disables trap placement and throttles corrupted worms (virus enters “dormant” mode).  
- **No Shell** – collapses every defensive shell wrapped around the Virus Block. (Tier 5)
- **Half HP** – halves the Virus Block’s *maximum* health.  
- **Bleed HP** – halves the Virus Block’s *current* health immediately. (EASY Mode Only)

### End the Apocalypse

- Once Apocalypse Mode begins, the bossbar flips to red HP.  
- Hits, TNT, beds, and Purification option 4 drain health.  
- When HP reaches zero (or you mine the exposed block), the infection is wiped and the world calms down.

## 🧨 Why This Mod Rocks for Streamers

- Every world becomes a dynamic storyline  
- Random chaos = endless clips  
- Viewers can predict and watch the infection escalate  
- Passive mobs turning hostile is peak content  
- TNT meteors + block collapse chains = living highlight reels  
- World slowly turning alien = insane thumbnails  
- Built-in tension arc: “What tier are we at!?”  
- Endgame boss is fully cinematic and world-altering  

This is a “progressive chaos” mod designed for content creation and challenge runs.
