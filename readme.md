# 🦠 THE VIRUS BLOCK — Beginning of the End

**A Minecraft mod that lets you destroy your entire world… one mutation at a time.**  
Place a single block.  
Watch your dimension collapse into chaos.

Perfect for:
- Streamers  
- Challenge runs  
- SMP events  
- “Hardcore but getting worse every minute” experiences  

Once the **Virus Block** is placed, your dimension enters a progressive, escalating corruption arc that alters every part of Minecraft: mobs, blocks, worldgen, weather, cave physics, and even player behavior.

There is no going back.  
Only survival.

## 🧬 Core Concept

When the Virus Block is activated:

- Your dimension is flagged as **infected**  
- Mutation systems turn on  
- Chaos escalates in **five infection tiers**  
- The world becomes progressively more hostile, unstable, and unpredictable  

This mod transforms Minecraft into a living apocalypse simulator.

## 📈 Infection Tiers

The Virus spreads through **five escalating tiers**:

### Tier 1 — Mild Corruption

- Adjacent blocks mutate into random variants  
- Single-block flickers / texture glitches  
- Passive mobs stare or follow players  
- Loaded chunk: 1 random block mutates every few seconds  
- Virus Aura: *Poison I* near the block (milk cures)

### Tier 2 — Environmental Decay

- Water turns murky  
- Random blocks throughout loaded chunks mutate  
- Small cave-ins during mining  
- Hostile arrows occasionally fall from the sky  
- Passive mobs become slightly aggressive

### Tier 3 — Hostile Ecosystem

- Zombies infect passive mobs  
- Terrain patches convert to corrupted biomes  
- TNT meteors fall occasionally  
- Trees decay or become twisted  
- Virus Aura upgraded: poison + hunger

### Tier 4 — Reality Warping

- Random gravity collapses  
- Blocks fall sideways or upward  
- Chunks visually “stutter”  
- Mobs gain random abilities: speed, crits, explosions, venom  
- Fluids misbehave in corrupted zones

### Tier 5 — The Endgame

- Biomes collapse or invert  
- Massive TNT/Arrow barrages  
- Terrain waves rise and fall  
- Entity duplication events  
- Boss anomaly spawns: **THE SINGULARITY**

Optional **Apocalypse Mode** unlocks beyond Tier 5.

## 🧩 Corrupted Block Variants

Every vanilla block can spawn a **corrupted variant**:

Examples:

- **Corrupted Stone:** behaves like sand  
- **Corrupted Glass:** explodes when broken  
- **Corrupted Dirt:** spawns bitey worms  
- **Corrupted Wood:** ignites when walked on  
- **Corrupted Iron Block:** magnetic pull on items  
- **Corrupted Ice:** creates hallucinations  

Over time, your world becomes an alien landscape.

## 🌪️ Global Mutation Events

These occur periodically or randomly:

- **Block Mutation Pulse**  
  Patches of blocks shift all at once into random variants.

- **Skyfall Event**  
  TNT / arrows / random objects rain down over players.

- **Passive Mob Revolt**  
  Cows, pigs, chickens, etc. become corrupted and hostile.

- **Mob Buff Storm**  
  All mobs gain random buffs (speed, strength, explosions, crits, etc.).

- **Liquid Mutation**  
  Water → sludge (slow + poison)  
  Lava → tainted lava (extra dangerous, smoke bursts)

- **Collapse Surge**  
  Stone caves collapse in chain reactions while mining.

- **Void Tears**  
  Temporary mini black holes that suck in nearby entities.

- **Inversion Event**  
  Falling blocks fall UP instead of down for a short duration.

- **Virus Bloom**  
  Plants and trees convert to corrupted flora instantly.

- **Entity Duplication**  
  Random mobs multiply into weaker clones for swarm chaos.

Every session becomes a unique apocalypse.

## 👁️ Virus Aura

The immediate area around the Virus Block becomes toxic:

- Poison  
- Hunger  
- Slowness  
- Nausea  
- Armor corrosion  
- Hallucination particles  

Aura strength scales with infection tier.

---

## ⚔️ Singularity Boss (Tier 5)

Once the corruption reaches maximum intensity, the dimension summons:

### 🌀 THE SINGULARITY

A corrupted anomaly boss that:

- Sucks blocks toward itself  
- Fires corruption beams  
- Distorts chunks and terrain  
- Summons corrupted mobs  
- Causes random teleports  
- Warps physics around it  

Defeating it stabilizes the dimension.  
Failing allows it to begin **deleting chunks** and collapsing the world.

---

## 🏛️ Player Tools & Interactions

### Accelerate Corruption

Feed the Virus Block powerful items to increase its tier faster.

### Delay Corruption

Build a containment structure around it (configurable effects).

### Temporary Reversion

Craft a **Purification Totem** (expensive, late-game).  
Purifies or cancels one mutation event.

### End the Apocalypse

Defeat **The Singularity** to freeze corruption where it stands.  
The world remains scarred, but no longer worsens.
