# 🦠 THE VIRUS BLOCK — Beginning of the End

**A Minecraft mod that lets you destroy your entire world… one mutation at a time.**  
Place a single block.  
Watch your dimension collapse into chaos.

Perfect for:
- Streamers  
- Challenge runs  
- SMP events  
- “Hardcore but getting worse every minute” experiences  

Once the **Virus Block** is placed, your dimension enters a progressive, escalating corruption arc that alters every part of Minecraft: mobs, blocks, worldgen, weather, cave physics, and even player behavior.

There is no going back.  
Only survival.

## 🧬 Core Concept

When the Virus Block is activated:

- Your dimension is flagged as **infected**  
- Mutation systems turn on  
- Chaos escalates in **five infection tiers**  
- The world becomes progressively more hostile, unstable, and unpredictable  

This mod transforms Minecraft into a living apocalypse simulator.

## 📈 Infection Tiers

The Virus spreads through **five escalating tiers**:

### Tier 1 — Mild Corruption

- Adjacent blocks mutate into random variants  
- Single-block flickers / texture glitches  
- Passive mobs stare or follow players  
- Loaded chunk: 1 random block mutates every few seconds  
- Virus Aura: *Poison I* near the block (milk cures)

### Tier 2 — Environmental Decay

- Water turns murky  
- Random blocks throughout loaded chunks mutate  
- Small cave-ins during mining  
- Hostile arrows occasionally fall from the sky  
- Passive mobs become slightly aggressive

### Tier 3 — Hostile Ecosystem

- Zombies infect passive mobs  
- Terrain patches convert to corrupted biomes  
- TNT meteors fall occasionally  
- Trees decay or become twisted  
- Virus Aura upgraded: poison + hunger

### Tier 4 — Reality Warping

- Random gravity collapses  
- Blocks fall sideways or upward  
- Chunks visually “stutter”  
- Mobs gain random abilities: speed, crits, explosions, venom  
- Fluids misbehave in corrupted zones

### Tier 5 — The Endgame

- Biomes collapse or invert  
- Massive TNT/Arrow barrages  
- Terrain waves rise and fall  
- Entity duplication events  
- Virus Block bossbar locks at 100%—once it fills, **Apocalypse Mode** begins.

### 🔻 Apocalypse Mode (Post-Tier 5)

Once the Tier 5 progress bar finishes, every Virus Block sheds its shells, the bossbar switches to a red health readout, and the corruption enters its terminal phase:

- The Virus Block becomes fully vulnerable; melee hits, arrows, TNT, and Purification option 4 all drain its health.
- Purification option 3 still halves the block’s max health, shortening the fight without rewinding progress.
- The calm/progress bossbar is hidden; only the red health bar remains while vulnerable.
- When Virus HP reaches zero *or* you finish mining the exposed block, the infection is cleansed and the world begins to recover.
- (Future roadmap: a Singularity-style fail-safe may return later if players ignore Apocalypse Mode for too long, but it is currently disabled.)

## 🧩 Corrupted Block Variants

Every vanilla block can spawn a **corrupted variant**:

Examples:

- **Corrupted Stone:** behaves like sand  
- **Corrupted Glass:** explodes when broken  
- **Corrupted Dirt:** spawns bitey worms  
- **Corrupted Wood:** ignites when walked on  
- **Corrupted Iron Block:** magnetic pull on items  
- **Corrupted Ice:** creates hallucinations  

Over time, your world becomes an alien landscape.

---

## 🌪️ Global Mutation Events

These occur periodically or randomly:

- **Block Mutation Pulse**  
  Patches of blocks shift all at once into random variants.

- **Skyfall Event**  
  TNT / arrows / random objects rain down over players.

- **Passive Mob Revolt**  
  Cows, pigs, chickens, etc. become corrupted and hostile.

- **Mob Buff Storm**  
  All mobs gain random buffs (speed, strength, explosions, crits, etc.).

- **Liquid Mutation**  
  Water → sludge (slow + poison)  
  Lava → tainted lava (extra dangerous, smoke bursts)

- **Collapse Surge**  
  Stone caves collapse in chain reactions while mining.

- **Void Tears**  
  Temporary mini black holes that suck in nearby entities.

- **Inversion Event**  
  Falling blocks fall UP instead of down for a short duration.

- **Virus Bloom**  
  Plants and trees convert to corrupted flora instantly.

- **Entity Duplication**  
  Random mobs multiply into weaker clones for swarm chaos.

Every session becomes a unique apocalypse.

## 👁️ Virus Aura

The immediate area around the Virus Block becomes toxic:

- Poison  
- Hunger  
- Slowness  
- Nausea  
- Armor corrosion  
- Hallucination particles  

Aura strength scales with infection tier.

---

## ⚔️ Ending the Infection

Apocalypse Mode is the last phase—there is no separate boss arena right now. Survive the Tier 5 chaos, keep accelerating the Virus Block’s progress, and once the bar flips to red health you can finally fight back:

- Every hit against the Virus Block removes health instead of rewinding progress.
- TNT, bed explosions, and projectiles all deal chunk-based damage; larger blasts chew away more HP.
- Purification totems remain powerful finishers—option 3 reduces max HP, option 4 burns current HP.
- When the health bar empties, the Virus Block disintegrates and the infection resets to zero sources.

## 🏛️ Player Tools & Interactions

### Accelerate Corruption

Feed the Virus Block powerful items to increase its tier faster.

### Delay Corruption

Build a containment structure around it (configurable effects).

### Temporary Reversion

Craft a **Purification Totem** (expensive, late-game).  
Purifies or cancels one mutation event. Choose between:

- **No Boobytraps** – disables trap placement and throttles corrupted worm influx.
- **No Shell** – collapses every defensive shell wrapped around the Virus Block.
- **Half HP** – halves the Virus Block’s *maximum* health for the current tier, shortening the remaining timeline without triggering shell collapse.
- **Bleed HP** – halves the Virus Block’s *current* health, rolling its boss bar backward immediately.

### End the Apocalypse

Drain the Virus Block’s health during Apocalypse Mode (or finish mining the exposed block) to wipe the infection.  
The world remains scarred, but no longer worsens.

## 🧨 Why This Mod Rocks for Streamers

- Every world becomes a dynamic storyline  
- Random chaos = endless clips  
- Viewers can predict and watch the infection escalate  
- Passive mobs turning hostile is peak content  
- TNT meteors + block collapse chains = living highlight reels  
- World slowly turning alien = insane thumbnails  
- Built-in tension arc: “What tier are we at!?”  
- Endgame boss is fully cinematic and world-altering  

This is a “progressive chaos” mod designed for content creation and challenge runs.

## 🧪 Debug Commands

- `/virustiers` – Shows the current infection tier, whether apocalypse mode is active, and every feature that is currently unlocked by the Tier Cookbook. Use this when tuning gamerules or designing new difficulty presets.
- `/virusboobytraps [radiusChunks]` – Lists every active boobytrap block around you (defaults to 8 chunks) so you can verify trap density or clean up a play area.

### Tier Feature Defaults

- **Tier 2:** liquid corruption, corrupted sand/ice/snow surfaces, Mutation Pulse, Skyfall, Collapse Surge, Passive Revolt, Mob Buff Storm, Virus Bloom.
- **Tier 3:** Void Tear, Inversion.
- **Tier 4:** Entity Duplication.
- **Tier 5:** (Reserved – apocalypse add-ons only.)

## 🛡️ Admin Commands

- `/virusblock waves friendlyfire <enable|disable|status>` – Toggles whether virus-spawned waves can hurt each other (requires permission level 2).
- `/virusblock teleport <enable|disable|radius <0-64>|status>` – Controls the automatic teleport ability of the Virus Block, including maximum radius in chunks.

## 🍳 Crafting Recipes

| Recipe | Inputs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cured Infectious Cube** | Shapeless: 1× Infectious Cube + 1× Milk Bucket | Produces 1× Cured Infectious Cube. Combine anywhere in the crafting grid. |
| **Purification Totem** | Shaped “cross” pattern: Top = Cured Infectious Cube, Left = Corrupted Gold, Center = Totem of Undying, Right = Corrupted Iron, Bottom = Corrupted Diamond | There are four JSON variants covering every rotation; the center slot must always be a Totem of Undying. Consumed on use. |

*(Drop your PNGs—`cured_infectious_cube.png`, `purification_totem.png`, etc.—into the repo’s `docs/` folder if you want the README to display the crafting layouts directly.)*

## 🛠️ Installation

> Placeholder instructions — adjust versions when implementing.

1. Install **Fabric Loader** (0.18.x or later)  
2. Install **Fabric API**  
3. Drop `virusblock-x.x.x.jar` into your `mods` folder  
4. Launch the game

Optional but recommended:

- Use shaders for maximum visual freakiness  
- Recommended performance mods: Sodium, Indium, Iris

## ⚙️ Configuration Reference

Most tuning happens through gamerules. Here are the high-impact ones (defaults in parentheses):

| Gamerule | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `virusSurfaceCorruptAttempts` | `640` | Attempts per tick for Tier‑2 surface mutation (sand/ice/snow carpets). Raise for faster biome takeovers. |
| `virusLiquidMutationEnabled` | `true` | Enables corrupted water/lava once Tier 2 is reached. |
| `virusCorruptSandEnabled` / `virusCorruptIceEnabled` / `virusCorruptSnowEnabled` | `true` | Opt individual surface conversions in/out. |
| `virusTier2EventsEnabled` | `true` | Master toggle for Tier‑2 global events (Mutation Pulse, Skyfall, etc.). |
| `virusTier3ExtrasEnabled` | `false` | Unlocks Tier‑3+ extras (Void Tear, Inversion, Entity Duplication). |
| `virusEventMutationPulseEnabled` … `virusEventEntityDuplicationEnabled` | `true` | Fine-grained switches for each event (Mutation Pulse, Skyfall, Collapse Surge, Passive Revolt, Mob Buff Storm, Virus Bloom, Void Tear, Inversion, Entity Duplication). Use these if you want to cherry-pick specific events without disabling the whole tier. |
| `virusMatrixCubeMaxActive` | `200` | Cap on simultaneous Matrix Cubes raining from the sky. |
| `virusBoobytrapsEnabled` | `true` | Controls spontaneous boobytrap placement/explosions. |
| `virusWormsEnabled` | `true` | Allows corrupted dirt/boobytraps to spawn corrupted worms. |
